	The Easy Publish and Consume library provides an easy method to:

    * publish data using HTTPS: EpcPublisher
    * announce that information via DNS-SD: EpcDispatcher
    * find that information: EpcConsumer
    * and finally consume it

	You can use this library as a key/value store published to the network,
	using encryption, authentication and service discovery.
