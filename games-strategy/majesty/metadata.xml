	Majesty for Linux contains both the full Majesty game, and the expansion
	pack, The Northern Expansion.

	Majesty is a unique sim putting you in the crushed velvet hotseat of your
	own kingdom. With an epic quest before you, you make the decisions of where
	to build your settlement`s guilds and temples. Each one has a mind of its
	own and must be enticed to meet your goals, via rewards you offer and spells
	you cast.

	Meanwhile you must make sure that your treasury stays flush with cash to
	support these and other outlays necessary to maintain a thriving medieval
	town. The fact that you are being barraged by attacks from mythical beasts
	and fantastic creatures doesn`t make your job any easier.
