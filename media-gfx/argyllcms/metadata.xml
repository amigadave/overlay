	ArgyllCMS is an ICC compatible color management system, available as Open
	Source. It supports accurate ICC profile creation for scanners, cameras and
	film recorders, and calibration and profiling of displays and RGB &amp; CMYK
	printers. Spectral sample data is supported, allowing a selection of
	illuminants observer types, and paper fluorescent whitener additive
	compensation. Profiles can also incorporate source specific gamut mappings
	for perceptual and saturation intents. Gamut mapping and profile linking
	uses the CIECAM02 appearance model, a unique gamut mapping algorithm, and a
	wide selection of rendering intents. Device Link can be created with a wide
	variety of advanced options. It also includes code for the fastest portable
	8 bit raster color conversion engine available anywhere, as well as support
	for fast, fully accurate 16 bit conversion. Device color gamuts can also be
	viewed and compared using a VRML viewer. Comprehensive documentation is
	provided for each utility, and a general guide to using the tools for
	typical color management tasks is also available. A mailing list provides
	support for more advanced usage.
