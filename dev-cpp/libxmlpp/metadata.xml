	 libxml++ is a C++ API for the popular libxml XML parser, written in C.
	 libxml is famous for its high performance and compliance to standard
	 specifications, but its C API is quite difficult even for common tasks.

	 libxml++ presents a simple C++-like API that can achieve common tasks with
	 less code. Unlike some other C++ parsers, it does not try to avoid the
	 advantages of standard C++ features such as namespaces, STL containers or
	 runtime type identification, and it does not try to conform to standard API
	 specifications meant for Java. Therefore libxml++ requires a fairly modern
	 C++ compiler such as g++ 3.
